<h2> Learning from the past to predict the future </h2>

<p> A fundemantal finding in neuroscience is that when stimuli are repeated, activation in the brain is reduced. I am interested in how repetition suppression may support the formation of predictions for social cognition and language.

<h2> The cerebellum for complex cognition </h2>

<font size="3">
<p>
<p>
<p> The cerebellum has historically been considered a motor structure. However, a vast majority of the cerebellum is functionally connected to non-motor, cognitive regions of the cerebral cortex.
  My research has focused on understanding how the cerebellum contributes to social cognition, language, and cognitive control. In particular, the cerebellum is a key structure for adaptive prediction in the sensorimotor domain.
  My work has provided causal evidence that the cerebellum contributes to adaptive prediction for social cognition and language as well.
