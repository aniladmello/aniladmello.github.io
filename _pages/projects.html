<h2> The cerebellum for complex cognition </h2>

<p>
<p> The cerebellum has historically been considered a motor structure. However, a vast majority of the cerebellum is functionally connected to non-motor, cognitive regions of the cerebral cortex.
  My research has focused on understanding how the cerebellum contributes to social cognition, language, and cognitive control. In particular, the cerebellum is a key structure for adaptive prediction in the sensorimotor domain.
  My work has provided causal evidence that the cerebellum contributes to adaptive prediction for social cognition and language as well. 
 
<p> How does the instrinsic organization of the cerebellum contribute to complex cognition? Some of our recent work shows that the cerebellum is organized hierarchically, with certain subregions representing abstract schema and other subregions representing proximal actions.
  These subregions interact to use past experience to prepare for the future in a context dependent manner.
  
<p> The cerebellum is also one of the most consistent sites of differences in autism spectrum disorder. Our work has found that cerebellar structural changes are associated with social and lingustic challenges in children with autism.
