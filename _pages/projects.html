<h2> The cerebellum for complex cognition </h2>

<font size="3">

<p> The cerebellum has historically been considered a motor structure. However, a vast majority of the cerebellum is functionally connected to non-motor, cognitive regions of the cerebral cortex.
  My research has focused on understanding how the cerebellum contributes to social cognition, language, and cognitive control.
