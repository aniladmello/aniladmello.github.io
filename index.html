<h1> Research </h1>

<p> Social cognition and language are exceptionally complex behaviors, engaging both low-level sensory and higher-order cognitive systems across short and long timescales.  

<p> My research combines behavioral experiments, multimodal neuroimaging, and neuromodulation to investigate the neural underpinnings of social cognition and language, and how alterations in these systems can affect social, linguistic, and perceptual behavior with relevance for development and disorders.
