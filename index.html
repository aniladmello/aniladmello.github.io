<p>The world around us is noisy and changes rapidly. To help us efficiently navigate ambiguous situations and rapidly adapt in the face of surprise, the brain creates internal models of our own actions, the actions and beliefs of others, and the world around us. These models can be used to predict what is likely to occur in a given context, such as what a social partner may think, do, or say. 

<p>I study how the brain generates and uses predictions to guide complex cognition, including social cognition and language. To do this, I integrate behavioral experimentation, multimodal neuroimaging, and neuromodulation in children and adults to understand the neural mechanisms and circuits that support the generation of predictions, and how disruptions in these systems affect social cognition and language.
